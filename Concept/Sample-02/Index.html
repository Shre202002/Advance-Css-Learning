                    affectionate. Several are astonishingly imitative of many sounds, including human speech.</p>

                    safe place immediately!. </p>
                <p class="para">Thunder is created when lightning passes through the air. The lightning discharge heats
                    the air rapidly and causes it to expand. The temperature of the air in the lightning channel may
                    reach as high as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun. Immediately
                    after the flash, the air cools and contracts quickly.</p>
